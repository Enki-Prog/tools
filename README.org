* git/

  The git subdirs currently contains a hook for git. The "update" hook.

** update

This script is intended to check the format of the log message.

 The following things are checked:

- Each changed files are mentioned (there is a list of ignored file).
- There must be at least one entry (unless there is no interesting
  file in the commit).
- There is one semicolon between two entries.
- There is less than 72 columns in the log message.
- There must be a title.
- No space before the semicolon (in French, there is one).
